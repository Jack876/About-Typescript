Block-scoped variable capturing

When we first touched on the idea of variable capturing with var declaration, we briefly went into how variables act once captured. To give a better intuition of this, each time a scope is run, it creates an “environment” of variables. That environment and its captured variables can exist even after everything within its scope has finished executing.

function theCityThatAlwaysSleeps() {
    let getCity;

    if (true) {
        let city = "Seattle";
        getCity = function() {
            return city;
        }
    }

    return getCity();
}
Because we’ve captured city from within its environment, we’re still able to access it despite the fact that the if block finished executing.

Recall that with our earlier setTimeout example, we ended up needing to use an IIFE to capture the state of a variable for every iteration of the for loop. In effect, what we were doing was creating a new variable environment for our captured variables. That was a bit of a pain, but luckily, you’ll never have to do that again in TypeScript.

let declarations have drastically different behavior when declared as part of a loop. Rather than just introducing a new environment to the loop itself, these declarations sort of create a new scope per iteration. Since this is what we were doing anyway with our IIFE, we can change our old setTimeout example to just use a let declaration.

for (let i = 0; i < 10 ; i++) {
    setTimeout(function() { console.log(i); }, 100 * i);
}
and as expected, this will print out

回想一下前面setTimeout的例子，我们最后需要使用立即执行的函数表达式来获取每次for循环迭代里的状态。 实际上，我们做的是为获取到的变量创建了一个新的变量环境。 这样做挺痛苦的，但是幸运的是，你不必在TypeScript里这样做了。

当let声明出现在循环体里时拥有完全不同的行为。 不仅是在循环里引入了一个新的变量环境，而是针对 每次迭代都会创建这样一个新作用域。 这就是我们在使用立即执行的函数表达式时做的事，所以在 setTimeout例子里我们仅使用let声明就可以了。

Advanced Techniques
Constructor functions

When you declare a class in TypeScript, you are actually creating multiple declarations at the same time. The first is the type of the instance of the class.

class Greeter {
    greeting: string;
    constructor(message: string) {
        this.greeting = message;
    }
    greet() {
        return "Hello, " + this.greeting;
    }
}

let greeter: Greeter;
greeter = new Greeter("world");
console.log(greeter.greet());
Here, when we say let greeter: Greeter, we’re using Greeter as the type of instances of the class Greeter. This is almost second nature to programmers from other object-oriented languages.

We’re also creating another value that we call the constructor function. This is the function that is called when we new up instances of the class. To see what this looks like in practice, let’s take a look at the JavaScript created by the above example:

let Greeter = (function () {
    function Greeter(message) {
        this.greeting = message;
    }
    Greeter.prototype.greet = function () {
        return "Hello, " + this.greeting;
    };
    return Greeter;
})();

let greeter;
greeter = new Greeter("world");
console.log(greeter.greet());
Here, let Greeter is going to be assigned the constructor function. When we call new and run this function, we get an instance of the class. The constructor function also contains all of the static members of the class. Another way to think of each class is that there is an instance side and a static side.
Let’s modify the example a bit to show this difference:

class Greeter {
    static standardGreeting = "Hello, there";
    greeting: string;
    greet() {
        if (this.greeting) {
            return "Hello, " + this.greeting;
        }
        else {
            return Greeter.standardGreeting;
        }
    }
}

let greeter1: Greeter;
greeter1 = new Greeter();
console.log(greeter1.greet());

let greeterMaker: typeof Greeter = Greeter;
greeterMaker.standardGreeting = "Hey there!";

let greeter2: Greeter = new greeterMaker();
console.log(greeter2.greet());
In this example, greeter1 works similarly to before. We instantiate the Greeter class, and use this object. This we have seen before.

Next, we then use the class directly. Here we create a new variable called greeterMaker. This variable will hold the class itself, or said another way its constructor function. Here we use typeof Greeter, that is “give me the type of the Greeter class itself” rather than the instance type. Or, more precisely, “give me the type of the symbol called Greeter,” which is the type of the constructor function. This type will contain all of the static members of Greeter along with the constructor that creates instances of the Greeter class. We show this by using new on greeterMaker, creating new instances of Greeter and invoking them as before.

Writing the function type

Now that we’ve typed the function, let’s write the full type of the function out by looking at the each piece of the function type.

let myAdd: (x: number, y: number)=>number =
    function(x: number, y: number): number { return x+y; };
A function’s type has the same two parts: the type of the arguments and the return type. When writing out the whole function type,


Functions
To begin, just as in JavaScript, TypeScript functions can be created both as a named function or as an anonymous function. This allows you to choose the most appropriate approach for your application, whether you’re building a list of functions in an API or a one-off function to hand off to another function.

To quickly recap what these two approaches look like in JavaScript:

// Named function
function add(x, y) {
    return x + y;
}

// Anonymous function
let myAdd = function(x, y) { return x+y; };
Just as in JavaScript, functions can refer to variables outside of the function body. When they do so, they’re said to capture these variables. While understanding how this works, and the trade-offs when using this technique, are outside of the scope of this article, having a firm understanding how this mechanic is an important piece of working with JavaScript and TypeScript.

let z = 100;

function addToZ(x, y) {
    return x + y + z;
}



Function Types
Typing the function

Let’s add types to our simple examples from earlier:

function add(x: number, y: number): number {
    return x + y;
}

let myAdd = function(x: number, y: number): number { return x+y; };
We can add types to each of the parameters and then to the function itself to add a return type. TypeScript can figure the return type out by looking at the return st


Inferring the types

In playing with the example, you may notice that the TypeScript compiler can figure out the type if you have types on one side of the equation but not the other:

// myAdd has the full function type
let myAdd = function(x: number, y: number): number { return  x + y; };

// The parameters 'x' and 'y' have the type number
let myAdd: (baseValue:number, increment:number) => number =
    function(x, y) { return x + y; };
This is called “contextual typing”, a form of type inference. This helps cut down on the amount of effort to keep your program typed.

Optional and Default Parameters
In TypeScript, every parameter is assumed to be required by the function. This doesn’t mean that it can’t be given null or undefined, but rather, when the function is called the compiler will check that the user has provided a value for each parameter. The compiler also assumes that these parameters are the only parameters that will be passed to the function. In short, the number of arguments given to a function has to match the number of parameters the function expects.

function buildName(firstName: string, lastName: string) {
    return firstName + " " + lastName;
}

let result1 = buildName("Bob");                  // error, too few parameters
let result2 = buildName("Bob", "Adams", "Sr.");  // error, too many parameters
let result3 = buildName("Bob", "Adams");         // ah, just right
In JavaScript, every parameter is optional, and users may leave them off as they see fit. When they do, their value is undefined. We can get this functionality in TypeScript by adding a ? to the end of parameters we want to be optional. For example, let’s say we want the last name parameter from above to be optional:

function buildName(firstName: string, lastName?: string) {
    if (lastName)
        return firstName + " " + lastName;
    else
        return firstName;
}

let result1 = buildName("Bob");                  // works correctly now
let result2 = buildName("Bob", "Adams", "Sr.");  // error, too many parameters
let result3 = buildName("Bob", "Adams");         // ah, just right
Any optional parameters must follow required parameters. Had we wanted to make the first name optional rather than the last name, we would need to change the order of parameters in the function, putting the first name last in the list.

In TypeScript, we can also set a value that a parameter will be assigned if the user does not provide one, or if the user passes undefined in its place. These are called default-initialized parameters. Let’s take the previous example and default the last name to "Smith".

function buildName(firstName: string, lastName = "Smith") {
    return firstName + " " + lastName;
}

let result1 = buildName("Bob");                  // works correctly now, returns "Bob Smith"
let result2 = buildName("Bob", undefined);       // still works, also returns "Bob Smith"
let result3 = buildName("Bob", "Adams", "Sr.");  // error, too many parameters
let result4 = buildName("Bob", "Adams");         // ah, just right
Default-initialized parameters that come after all required parameters are treated as optional, and just like optional parameters, can be omitted when calling their respective function. This means optional parameters and trailing default parameters will share commonality in their types, so both

function buildName(firstName: string, lastName?: string) {
    // ...
}
and


function buildName(firstName: string, lastName = "Smith") {
    // ...
}
share the same type (firstName: string, lastName?: string) => string. The default value of lastName disappears in the type, only leaving behind the fact that the parameter is optional.

Unlike plain optional parameters, default-initialized parameters don’t need to occur after required parameters. If a default-initialized parameter comes before a required parameter, users need to explicitly pass undefined to get the default initialized value. For example, we could write our last example with only a default initializer on firstName:

function buildName(firstName = "Will", lastName: string) {
    return firstName + " " + lastName;
}

let result1 = buildName("Bob");                  // error, too few parameters
let result2 = buildName("Bob", "Adams", "Sr.");  // error, too many parameters
let result3 = buildName("Bob", "Adams");         // okay and returns "Bob Adams"
let result4 = buildName(undefined, "Adams");     // okay and returns "Will Adams"


Rest Parameters
Required, optional, and default parameters all have one thing in common: they talk about one parameter at a time. Sometimes, you want to work with multiple parameters as a group, or you may not know how many parameters a function will ultimately take. In JavaScript, you can work with the arguments directly using the arguments variable that is visible inside every function body.

In TypeScript, you can gather these arguments together into a variable:

function buildName(firstName: string, ...restOfName: string[]) {
    return firstName + " " + restOfName.join(" ");
}

let employeeName = buildName("Joseph", "Samuel", "Lucas", "MacKinzie");
Rest parameters are treated as a boundless number of optional parameters. When passing arguments for a rest parameter, you can use as many as you want; you can even pass none. The compiler will build an array of the arguments passed in with the name given after the ellipsis (...), allowing you to use it in your function.

The ellipsis is also used in the type of the function with rest parameters:


function buildName(firstName: string, ...restOfName: string[]) {
    return firstName + " " + restOfName.join(" ");
}

let buildNameFun: (fname: string, ...rest: string[]) => string = buildName;
this
Learning how to use this in JavaScript is something of a rite of passage. Since TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, TypeScript developers also need to learn how to use this and how to spot when it’s not being used correctly. Fortunately, TypeScript lets you catch incorrect uses of this with a couple of techniques. If you need to learn how this works in JavaScript, though, first read Yehuda Katz’s Understanding JavaScript Function Invocation and “this”. Yehuda’s article explains the inner workings of this very well, so we’ll just cover the basics here.

this and arrow functions

In JavaScript, this is a variable that’s set when a function is called. This makes it a very powerful and flexible feature, but it comes at the cost of always having to know about the context that a function is executing in. This is notoriously confusing, especially when returning a function or passing a function as an argument.

Let’s look at an example:

let deck = {
    suits: ["hearts", "spades", "clubs", "diamonds"],
    cards: Array(52),
    createCardPicker: function() {
        return function() {
            let pickedCard = Math.floor(Math.random() * 52);
            let pickedSuit = Math.floor(pickedCard / 13);

            return {suit: this.suits[pickedSuit], card: pickedCard % 13};
        }
    }
}

let cardPicker = deck.createCardPicker();
let pickedCard = cardPicker();

alert("card: " + pickedCard.card + " of " + pickedCard.suit);
Notice that createCardPicker is a function that itself returns a function. If we tried to run the example, we would get an error instead of the expected alert box. This is because the this being used in the function created by createCardPicker will be set to window instead of our deck object. That’s because we call cardPicker() on its own. A top-level non-method syntax call like this will use window for this. (Note: under strict mode, this will be undefined rather than window).

We can fix this by making sure the function is bound to the correct this before we return the function to be used later. This way, regardless of how it’s later used, it will still be able to see the original deck object. To do this, we change the function expression to use the ECMAScript 6 arrow syntax. Arrow functions capture the this where the function is created rather than where it is invoked:

let deck = {
    suits: ["hearts", "spades", "clubs", "diamonds"],
    cards: Array(52),
    createCardPicker: function() {
        // NOTE: the line below is now an arrow function, allowing us to capture 'this' right here
        return () => {
            let pickedCard = Math.floor(Math.random() * 52);
            let pickedSuit = Math.floor(pickedCard / 13);

            return {suit: this.suits[pickedSuit], card: pickedCard % 13};
        }
    }
}

let cardPicker = deck.createCardPicker();
let pickedCard = cardPicker();

alert("card: " + pickedCard.card + " of " + pickedCard.suit);
Even better, TypeScript will warn you when you make this mistake if you pass the --noImplicitThis flag to the compiler. It will point out that this in this.suits[pickedSuit] is of type any.

this parameters

Unfortunately, the type of this.suits[pickedSuit] is still any. That’s because this comes from the function expression inside the object literal. To fix this, you can provide an explicit this parameter. this parameters are fake parameters that come first in the parameter list of a function:

function f(this: void) {
    // make sure `this` is unusable in this standalone function
}


Let’s add a couple of interfaces to our example above, Card and Deck, to make the types clearer and easier to reuse:

interface Card {
    suit: string;
    card: number;
}
interface Deck {
    suits: string[];
    cards: number[];
    createCardPicker(this: Deck): () => Card;
}
let deck: Deck = {
    suits: ["hearts", "spades", "clubs", "diamonds"],
    cards: Array(52),
    // NOTE: The function now explicitly specifies that its callee must be of type Deck
    createCardPicker: function(this: Deck) {
        return () => {
            let pickedCard = Math.floor(Math.random() * 52);
            let pickedSuit = Math.floor(pickedCard / 13);

            return {suit: this.suits[pickedSuit], card: pickedCard % 13};
        }
    }
}

let cardPicker = deck.createCardPicker();
let pickedCard = cardPicker();

alert("card: " + pickedCard.card + " of " + pickedCard.suit);
Now TypeScript knows that createCardPicker expects to be called on a Deck object. That means that this is of type Deck now, not any, so --noImplicitThis will not cause any errors.
